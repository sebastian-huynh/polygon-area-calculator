# Polygon Calculations With Python
This is one of the practices I completed for the "Scientific Computing with Python" certificate from freecodecamp.org. <br>
"test_module" and "main" were already given, "shape_calculator" is the file I developed code in. <br><br>
**Practice Instructions**: [View Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/polygon-area-calculator) <br>
**Replit link to test run this project for yourself**: [View Here](https://replit.com/@sebastian-huynh/polygon-area-calculator) <br><br>
There are two classes of polygons that this project focuses on: <br>
- **Rectangle** objects initialize with two parameters in case of differing lengths between shape height and width. <br>
- **Square** objects initialize with only one parameter for the length of a side (as squares have the same length on all sides) and inherits the methods from the **Rectangle** class as a subclass. <br>

"shape_calculator" holds methods that can be called from main to set/mutate or get/return the width/height values of a particular shape. It also contains further methods for: <br>
- **measuring diagonal length** (even for squares as the width and height are derived from the given side length for calculations)
- **seeing how many of X shapes will fit in Y shape** (done by diving the areas of the two shapes) <br>
