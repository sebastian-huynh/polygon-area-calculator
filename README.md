# Polygon Calculations With Python
This is one of the practices I completed for the "Scientific Computing with Python" certificate from freecodecamp.org. <br>
"test_module" and "main" were already given, "shape_calculator" is the file I developed code in. <br><br>
There are two classes of polygons that this project focuses on: <br>
- **Rectangle** objects accept two parameters in case of differing lengths between shape height and width. <br>
- **Square** objects accept only one parameter for a side length (as squares have the same length on all sides) <br>
